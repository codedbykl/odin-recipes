  <h2>About the recipe</h2>

  <p>
    Chirashi is similar to a Hawaiian poke bowl, but it takes less time to
    make because the fish isn’t dressed. It’s a great go-to weeknight meal, as
    you can prepare the toppings while the rice cooks. Then, season the cooked
    rice, add the toppings, and you have a restaurant-quality meal in about 30
    minutes.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>4 extra-jumbo unpeeled shrimp (about 3 ounces)</li>
    <li>1 ounce snow peas</li>
    <li>2 cups cooked sushi rice</li>
    <li>
      8 ounces sashimi-grade salmon, tuna, or yellow tail, cut into 1/4-inch
      cubes or slices
    </li>
    <li>4 slices tamagoyaki</li>
    <li>6 thin slices English cucumber (about 1/8 cucumber)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup microgreens (any kind)</li>
    <li>2 whole shiso leaves (optional)</li>
    <li>Shredded nori, to garnish</li>
    <li>Soy sauce, to serve</li>
    <li>Wasabi, to serve</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Steam the shrimp and snow peas</h3>
      <p>
        Add about 1 inch of water in a pot large enough to hold a steamer
        basket inside. Add the steamer basket in the pot, making sure the
        water doesn’t touch the bottom of it. Place the shrimp and snow peas
        in the basket. Set the pot over high heat and bring it up to a boil.
        As soon as it comes to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer, cover the
        pot, and let steam for 4 minutes until the shrimp is pink and opaque
        and the snow peas are tender and bright green.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Meanwhile, assemble the chirashi</h3>
      <p>
        Divide the rice into 2 bowls. Arrange the sashimi, tamagoyaki,
        cucumbers, microgreens, and shiso, if using, on top of each bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the shrimp is cool enough to handle, peel and add 2 into each
        bowl along with the snow peas.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Garnish and serve</h3>
      <p>
        Garnish each bowl with shredded nori and serve immediately with soy
        sauce and wasabi on the side for dipping the sashimi into.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chirashi should be consumed right away since it has raw fish on top.
