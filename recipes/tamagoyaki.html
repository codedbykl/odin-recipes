  <h2>About the recipe</h2>

  <p>
    Tamagoyaki is a rolled egg omelet, slightly sweetened with sugar and
    seasoned with soy sauce, mirin, and dashi. Tamago means “egg” and yaki
    means “grill” in Japanese.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon instant dashi powder, like Ajinomoto Hondashi</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon mirin</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>Grated daikon, for serving (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Make the dashi stock</h3>
      <p>
        In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, combine the 1/4 cup warm water
        and dashi powder. Mix with a fork until the granules dissolve. The
        warm water simply helps them dissolve, so don’t stress if you use room
        temperature or cold water.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Beat the eggs</h3>
      <p>
        In a medium bowl, add the eggs, sugar, and salt. Use a fork to beat
        the eggs until thoroughly combined. Try not to incorporate too many
        bubbles.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Season the eggs</h3>
      <p>
        Add the dashi stock, soy sauce, and mirin. Mix until the ingredients
        are incorporated.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Strain the eggs (optional)</h3>
      <p>
        For a silkier custard-like texture, strain the eggs through a fine
        mesh strainer set over a liquid measuring cup with the spout—it will
        make pouring the egg batter into the pan easier.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Grease and heat the pan</h3>
      <p>
        Place the oil in a small bowl and dip a small, folded paper towel into
        it. Use the saturated paper towel to wipe the inside of a kotobuki
        tamagoyaki or small nonstick pan. Heat the skillet over medium heat,
        enough to immediately start cooking the eggs when they are added but
        not so hot that they brown right away, then reduce the heat to
        medium-low.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Cook the first layer</h3>
      <p>
        Pour a small amount of batter into the pan, just enough to fully coat
        the bottom. Cook until it is mostly set, with the top still slightly
        liquidy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use chopsticks or a thin fish spatula to lift one end, flipping and
        rolling it over to the opposite end of the pan. Don’t worry if the
        first couple of flips are wrinkled or scrunched up. Just keep on
        rolling with it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Add two more layers:</h3>
      <p>
        Use the oil-saturated paper towel to wipe the skillet with more oil,
        lifting the cooked egg up to get some oil under it. Then pour more egg
        batter in, just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. Lift the cooked
        egg up slightly and tilt the pan so the egg batter can get under it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cook until it’s mostly set. Roll the eggs again the opposite
        direction, building up layers, sort of like building a snowman. Repeat
        this process one more time, oiling the pan, adding more egg batter,
        and rolling it back the other way. You will have used half the egg
        batter at this point.
      </p>
      <p>Slide the tamagoyaki onto a serving plate or a cutting board.</p>
      <p>
        Make a second tamagoyaki with the remaining batter following the same
        process.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Serve the tamagoyaki</h3>
      <p>
        Cut the tamagoyaki into 1-inch slices to reveal the swirls inside.
        Serve with grated daikon radish on the side, if you’d like, or as part
        of a larger Japanese-inspired meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leftovers can be refrigerated for 3 or 4 days. Though you can serve it
        cold, I like to remove it from the fridge and let it sit on the
        counter for 30 minutes or so to take the chill off. You can also heat
        it up briefly in the microwave in 15-second bursts until warmed
        through.
