# Odin Recipes

This project was coded to practice the HTML knowledge acquired at Foundations Course (in the HTML Foundations part) of The Odin Project.

It's a simple recipe site that has links to different recipes from one main page.

> P.S. The HTML markup is very basic right now (no section divisions, for example), as proposed in the project assignment. I'll improve it soon when I start working on the style and page layout.
